# PR.8-NumPy Analyzer Project

## 📌 Project Description

NumPy Analyzer is a Python-based project designed to perform various array operations using the NumPy library.
The project follows **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and provides a **menu-driven interface** for easy interaction.

This project is mainly developed for **academic purposes**, including lab work, mini projects, and practical exams.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To understand and implement NumPy array operations
* To apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python
* To perform data analysis using arrays
* To build a menu-driven Python application
  
## ✨ Features

* Creation of one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays
* Indexing and slicing of arrays
* Mathematical operations on arrays
* Combining and splitting arrays
* Searching elements in arrays
* Sorting and filtering data
* Statistical analysis such as sum, mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation
* User-friendly menu-driven interface

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Python Programming Language
* NumPy Library
* VS Code or any Python-supported IDE

## 📂 Project Structure
The project contains a Python file for implementation and a README file for documentation.

## 📸 Output
The output of the project is displayed in the **terminal/console**, where users can select options from the menu and view results based on their inputs.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

* Clear understanding of NumPy fundamentals
* Practical use of OOP concepts
* Improved problem-solving skills
* Experience with data analysis operations
  
## ✅ Conclusion

The NumPy Analyzer project successfully demonstrates how NumPy can be used for efficient array processing and data analysis.
